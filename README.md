# A project for reading input files and using logic to simulate data. 
# In this scenario, a car wash was simulated using data inputs such as car arrival time, car number, car wash start time, departure time, opening time of car wash, wait time, and total time
# program takes input file such as .txt with data formatted in a table.
# stats are displayed at the end of simulation that show total wait time, average wait time, total car wash use time, and the percentage of time car wash was in use.
